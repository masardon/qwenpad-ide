# QwenPad IDE Architecture

## Overview

QwenPad IDE is built on the foundation of the original Acode editor with significant extensions to support advanced development capabilities. The architecture maintains compatibility with the original codebase while adding new functionality through a modular plugin system, including automated project scaffolding, specialized managers for SSH and Kubernetes, and comprehensive dependency management.

## Core Components

### 1. Editor Core
- Based on Ace editor with customizations
- Handles syntax highlighting, code completion, and editing features
- Supports 100+ programming languages
- Tabbed interface for multiple files

### 2. File System Abstraction
- Unified interface for local, Termux, and remote file systems
- Supports Document Provider APIs for external storage access
- Handles special cases for Termux content URIs
- Provides file operation consistency across different storage types

### 3. Terminal System
- Cordova plugins for shell command execution
- Alpine Linux sandbox environment
- Real-time process streaming
- Support for both local and remote command execution

### 4. Plugin Framework
- Extensible architecture for adding new features
- Theme-specific and functional plugin support
- Dynamic loading of extensions
- API for plugin-to-core communication

## Security Considerations

- Sandboxed execution environment for terminal commands
- Secure storage for SSH keys and credentials
- Permission management for file system access
- API key management for cloud services
- Encrypted storage for sensitive configuration data

## Performance Optimizations

- Efficient file handling for large codebases
- Caching mechanisms for remote file access
- Optimized AI context management
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Asynchronous dependency installation and updates
