# QwenPad IDE Dependency Management System

## Overview

The QwenPad IDE Dependency Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing project dependencies across multiple programming languages and frameworks. It provides automated dependency installation, updating, and management with security scanning and version conflict resolution.

## Supported Languages and Package Managers

- **Features**:
  - Automatic detection of preferred package manager
  - Installation of dependencies and devDependencies
  - Updating to latest compatible versions
  - Security vulnerability scanning

### Python
- **Package Managers**: pip, pipenv, conda
- **Configuration Files**: `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile`, `setup.py`
- **Features**:

  - Version resolution and conflict detection

### Java/Kotlin
- **Build Tools**: Maven, Gradle
- **Configuration Files**: `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts`
- **Features**:
  - Multi-module project dependency management
  - Build tool integration
  - Dependency tree visualization
  - Security vulnerability scanning

### Dart/Flutter
- **Package Manager**: Pub
- **Configuration Files**: `pubspec.yaml`
- **Features**:
  - Flutter and Dart package management
  - Dependency constraint resolution
  - Development dependency handling
  - Outdated package detection

## Architecture

The Dependency Management System follows a plugin-based architecture with:

1. **Universal Dependency Manager**: The main orchestrator that detects project types and routes requests to appropriate managers
2. **Language-Specific Managers**: Individual classes for each language ecosystem
3. **File System Interface**: Integration with the underlying file system abstraction
4. **Security Scanner**: Component for checking vulnerabilities
5. **UI Integration**: Components for displaying dependency information

## Key Features

### Automatic Detection
The system automatically detects the project type by scanning for characteristic configuration files:
- JavaScript/Node.js: `package.json`
- Python: `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`
- Go: `go.mod`
- Rust: `Cargo.toml`
- Java/Kotlin: `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`
- Dart/Flutter: `pubspec.yaml`

### Project Scaffolding Integration
The dependency manager integrates with the project scaffolding system to automatically install dependencies when creating new projects:
```javascript
// Example usage in project creation
const newProject = await Scaffolding.createProject('react', 'my-app', '/path/to/projects');
await DependencyManager.install('/path/to/projects/my-app');
```

### One-Click Operations
Users can perform common dependency operations with single clicks:
- Install all dependencies
- Update all dependencies
- Install specific packages
- Remove packages
- Check for outdated packages

### Security Scanning
The system includes security scanning capabilities to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies. This integrates with public vulnerability databases to provide real-time security insights.

### Version Conflict Resolution
When multiple dependencies require different versions of the same package, the system attempts to resolve conflicts by:
- Finding compatible versions that satisfy all requirements
- Alerting users to unresolvable conflicts
- Providing manual resolution options

## UI Components

The dependency management system provides several UI components:

1. **Dependency Explorer**: Visual tree view of project dependencies
2. **Outdated Package List**: Shows packages that have newer versions available
3. **Security Report**: Highlights dependencies with known vulnerabilities
4. **Package Installer**: Allows adding new packages to the project

## API Interface

The system provides a unified API that all language managers implement:

```javascript
interface DependencyManager {
  async install(projectPath: string): Promise<boolean>;
  async update(projectPath: string): Promise<boolean>;
  async list(projectPath: string): Promise<Dependency[]>;
  async outdated(projectPath: string): Promise<OutdatedDependency[]>;
}
```

## Security and Privacy

- Dependencies are installed only in project contexts
- No telemetry collected during dependency operations
- User credentials are never stored or transmitted
- Secure HTTPS connections for package registries

## Performance Considerations

- Caching of package metadata to reduce network requests
- Asynchronous operations to prevent UI freezing
- Selective dependency analysis rather than full project scans
- Optimized algorithms for dependency resolution
