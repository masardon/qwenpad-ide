- **File System**: Custom file system abstraction supporting local, Termux, and remote storage
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for adding new functionality
- **AI Integration Layer**: API-based connection to Qwen AI models

## Plugins Architecture

The enhanced version includes several new plugins:

- **Git Plugin**: Provides Git operations through the terminal executor
- **SSH Manager**: Handles SSH connections and key management
- **Cloud Connectors**: Plugins for AWS, GCP, Azure integration
- **Kubernetes Manager**: kubectl integration and cluster tools
- **IaC Tools**: Integration with Terraform, Ansible, and other IaC tools
- **Qwen AI Assistant**: AI-powered coding assistance
